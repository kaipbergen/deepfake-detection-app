## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepfake-detection-app.git
cd deepfake-detection-app
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download the trained model:
   - Place your trained model file as `deepfake_final_model.keras` in the root directory
   - Or train your own model using the provided training scripts

## Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:7860
```

3. Upload an image to analyze for deepfake detection

## Training Your Own Model

The repository includes training scripts for creating custom deepfake detection models:

- `deepfake_model.py` - Basic training script
- `deepfake_model_working.py` - Optimized training script
- `deepfake_model_final.py` - Final production-ready script
